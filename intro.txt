This is where notes and questions will be...

adding :<type> will add type checking

compilerOptions - target - ESNext will compile to modern js
outDir - whatever folder name will output js files at compilation to that folder 

Union types - combination of types  -> :(number|string)

interface -> like class describes objects. Create your interface and then when you use an object in a function just provide it to the arg 

optional properties can be added to interfaces with propertyName?: kdjdkjwkjwkd

npx nodemon examples/example.ts to continuously run ts files and output when changes happen

type can create custom types to use in your code and interfaces -> type IdName = 'streamer'|'worker'
//reinstall deps if ts-node not working npx ts-node examples/example.ts to run ts files (example)

for functions -> ():type what does it return 
Questions: do you use inferred types in your code or do you annotate everything
